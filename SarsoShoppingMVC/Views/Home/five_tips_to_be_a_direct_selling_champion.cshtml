                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px !important;">Direct selling – the most viable way to start a business without an investment. Hailed for its flexibility, a direct selling business with Swadharma can be started from home without any hassle or prerequisites. There are various preconceptions about attaining success in this business. But the bottom line is growth in direct selling comes from the same things that make any other business a success. A simple breakdown for it is you have to know your market, find your targeted audience, and tell them how you differentiate. However, champions in Swadharma play their cards with a difference as bigger dreams require different efforts. So, here are a few direct selling tips for those who wish to go an extra mile:</p>
                        <ol style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px !important;">
                            <li><strong>Use What You Sell –</strong>A discerning customer will always figure out your enthusiasm and product knowledge as you pitch it to them. They would know whether it is coming from your personal experience or merely through an effort to sell. Using and loving Swadharma products that you are selling will reflect confidence, honesty, and accuracy of information in your sales pitch. An honest self-experience of using Swadharma products will be a key driver to close the sale.</li>
                            <li><strong>Understand the Rules – </strong>An essential step to grow your business is to understand Swadharma’s compensation plan, company policies and procedures. As Swadharma’s independent direct selling professional, you need to abide by the code of conduct and reflect the culture you are into. Further, to maximize your income, you need to know the best ways to make money. Out of 16 income modules from Swadharma’s extensive compensation plan, you should plan the income modules you want to earn through, making this planning your monthly, quarterlyor yearly activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identify Your Targeted Audience – </strong>Some people make this mistake of pitching a product to everyone they know. But that’s not the right way to go about it. Defining targeted audience for Swadharma’s wellness, skin care, hair care, household range and more will save you a lot of time as you will not make efforts selling products to people who don’t need them. Rather, by having a well-defined buyer in mind for instance for Swadharma skin care range, you will double your chances of closing a sale. And when you find people who need both; productsand a flexible business opportunity to work, you hit the nail straight on the head.</li>
                            <li><strong>Present your Business Opportunity – </strong>The direct selling professionals who frequently present Swadharma’s flexible business opportunity are more likely to close sales and recruit distributors in their business centers. In today’s socially distanced world, technology has allowed some flexibility in making presentations. Rather video calling apps, hosting online meetings or webinars give you a wider reach to invite people outside of your local area or city. So, the more presentations you give your prospects, the better are your chances of closing sales.</li>
                            <li><strong>Follow Up – </strong>The luck is in the follow-up. Staying in touch with prospects, clients, and new business builders puts you in a win-win situation. A direct selling champion doesn’t give up by receiving a few rejections. You must understand that a denial may not be the right time to sell a product or recruit a person. However, positively affirmed continued contact may provide you repeat customers and referrals.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px !important;">Lastly, you’ve got to stick to Swadharma business. Make a commitment to not quit despite what naysayers tell you.
